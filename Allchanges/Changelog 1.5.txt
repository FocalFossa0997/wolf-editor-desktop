===Wolf Editor 1.5 Changes==========
- Saving files works slightly different now, you can find your files in the "WolfEditorDocuments" folder.
-The changelog.txt file is now included with the Windows x64 version of Wolf Editor. You can load it in by clicking the Changelog button. Located here: ^^^^^^^^^^
===Upcoming Features==========
-Ability to change text area size
-Make right clicking in the text area function
-Use a file menu to save and load files instead of forcing the user to enter a file path
===Known Problems==========
-The .exe version comes with a lot of extra dll files, this is because this was made in python, and python needs a lot of library files by default to function properly. I could just use the --onefile option to remedy this when freezing the code, but that causes the application to not start properly.
-The application does not propmt you if you want to save when clicking the 'X' button, please save and then close it to prevent data loss
